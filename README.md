Hello,

My name is <ins>Moran Treibochan</ins>.

In order to show my automations skills, I build mini automation test with 3 automatic scenarios:

<ins>**Test 1**</ins> - Verifying successful entrance to easyeay site by locating the main page header.

<ins>**Test 2**</ins> - Navigate to contact sales page and filling the form.

<ins>**Test 3**</ins> - Navigate to the dashboard system, changing the automation focus to the dashboard tab, login the system with credentials stored in DB, and activating the admin settings. 
 
For this mini automation project I built the infrastructure from scratch, using java, page-objects model, and additional tools such as: Maven, TestNG, Selenium, mySQL and Allure-Report.
Used version control system (git) to upload all the code to github.

The <ins>src/main/java</ins> directory contains all the infrastructure files and methods and the <ins>src/test/java</ins> directory contains the test scenarios.
